# Webdev Project - E-Commerce Perfumery Retail Website with PHP, PostgreSQL, JavaScript


This is my several-years-old Bachelor's Computer Science project on an E-Commerce 'Perfume Retail Store' that utilized PHP, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, along with the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

It has not been updated or maintained since 2018, as it was built using older technologies and libraries. Nonetheless, I had a great time learning and experimenting with the DBMS and JavaScript modules, despite being restricted to outdated academic tech stack requirements.
