# Webdev Project - E-Commerce Perfumery Retail Website with PHP, PostgreSQL, JavaScript


This is my quite a few years old Bachelors Computer Science project  of  E-Commerce 'Perfume Retail Store' which used PHP,  JavaScript, PostgreSQL along with the basics of HTML and CSS. 

Not updated or maintained since 2018 as old technologies and libraries were used to build this but had fun learning and experimenting with the  DBMS & JavaScript modules, albeit stricken with outdated academic tech stack requisites.

Uploading for archival and documentation.
